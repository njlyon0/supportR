\title{Check Columns for Non-Numbers}
\usage{
num_check(data = NULL, col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(dataframe) object containing at least one column of supposed numbers}

\item{col}{(character or numeric) name(s) or column number(s) of the column(s) containing putative numbers in the data object}
}
\value{
(list) malformed numbers from each supplied column in separate list elements
}
\description{
Identifies any elements in the column(s) that would be changed to NA if \code{as.numeric} is used on the column(s). This is useful for quickly identifying only the "problem" entries of ostensibly numeric column(s) that is/are read in as a character.
}
\examples{
# Create dataframe with a numeric column where some entries would be coerced into NA
spp <- c("salmon", "bass", "halibut", "eel")
ct <- c(1, "14x", "_23", 12)
ct2 <- c("a", "2", "4", "0")
ct3 <- c(NA, "Y", "typo", "2")
fish <- data.frame("species" = spp, "count" = ct, "num_col2" = ct2, "third_count" = ct3)

# Use `num_check()` to return only the entries that would be lost
supportR::num_check(data = fish, col = c("count", "num_col2", "third_count"))
