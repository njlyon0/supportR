#' @title Compare Difference Between Two Vectors
#'
#' @description Reflexively compares two vectors and identifies (1) elements that are found in the first but not the second (i.e., "lost" components) and (2) elements that are found in the second but not the first (i.e., "gained" components). This is particularly helpful when manipulating a dataframe and comparing what columns are lost or gained between wrangling steps. Alternately it can compare the contents of two columns to see how two dataframes differ.
#'
#' @param old (vector) starting / original object
#' @param new (vector) ending / modified object
#' @param sort (logical) whether to sort the difference between the two vectors
#' @param return (logical) whether to return the two vectors as a 2-element list
#'
#' @return No return value (unless `return = TRUE`), called for side effects. If `return = TRUE`, returns a two-element list
