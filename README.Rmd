`supportR` is an R package where the only unifying theme of the functions is honestly just that I wrote them. That said, there are some useful functions for **data wrangling** and **plotting** in particular, though functions for _other purposes_ are also included. Check out the package website ([njlyon0.github.io/supportR](https://njlyon0.github.io/supportR/)) for documentation of the functions currently included in the package. I'll add functions to this package as I write more orphan scripts that I hope others might find useful so stay tuned!

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njlyon0/supportR")
```

## Looking Ahead

More functions are likely to be developed and housed within this package so stay tuned! Feel free to check out [the contributing guidelines](https://njlyon0.github.io/supportR/CONTRIBUTING.html) if you want to know how to contribute directly to `supportR`.
